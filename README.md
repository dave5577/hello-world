Testing GitHub functionality

This is an update to the readme to test correct push behaviour regarding a project happening on another account 13/04/2020.

This is a readme update to test atom editor interaction is working correctly for merging changes in local folders. This test worked as expected (clicking Fetch button and Pull worked). This line was added locally to confirm changes are visible and can be re-staged & pushed back up.
